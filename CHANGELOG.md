## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `UvicornAccessFilter` logging module that suppresses noisy 200 OK access logs for dashboard observability endpoints. At `WARNING` level all successful requests are hidden; at `INFO` level only dashboard polls are filtered, keeping errors visible. `src/core/logging.py`.
- `/v1/models` now dynamically fetches upstream provider models and appends them to the response. `OpenAIClient.list_models()` calls the backend `/v1/models`, and the endpoint merges discovered models alongside the existing Claude aliases and custom env mappings.
- Codex server-side web search (Tavily). When `TAVILY_API_KEY` is set, `web_search` built-in tools from Codex CLI are promoted to OpenAI function tools, the proxy injects `SEARCH_TOOL_SYSTEM_SUPPLEMENT` into the system prompt, and `run_search_loop()` executes the search server-side (same pattern as the Claude Code path). A new `codex_response_to_sse()` generator converts the final non-streaming response into synthetic SSE events for streaming clients. Files: `src/codex/tools_compat.py`, `src/codex/request_converter.py`, `src/codex/stream_converter.py`, `src/api/endpoints.py`.
- `docs/codex/CODEX_STATUSLINE.md` — documentation for Codex CLI proxy routing (`openai_base_url`, `model_provider`) and statusline configuration (TOML `tui.status_line`), plus a shell-prompt workaround for live context-usage display.
- Codex proxy tool compatibility (Unit 2): `CodexToolContext` and `tools_compat.py` with parsing, conversion, and remapping for string tools, custom tools (multi-suffix proxy functions), namespace tools (flatten/unflatten), built-in tools (`web_search`/`local_shell`/`computer_use`), and standard function passthrough.
- Codex proxy stream converter (Unit 5): OpenAI SSE → Responses API SSE events with state machine for text/tool buffering, event ordering, and usage accumulation.
- Codex proxy response converter (Unit 4): OpenAI Chat Completion → Responses API output items, usage mapping, and tool name remapping.
- Codex proxy request converter (Unit 3): Responses API → OpenAI Chat Completions (instructions→system, input items→messages, reasoning effort, model mapping).
- Codex proxy foundation (Unit 1): Pydantic models, config vars, model mapping.
- Codex streaming tool-call completion events (`response.function_call_arguments.done` and `response.output_item.done` for function items).
- Codex streaming session saving: the `previous_response_id` multi-turn chain now works for streaming requests (previously only supported non-streaming).
  configured, the proxy injects a short system-prompt line telling the model to
  call web search on its own turn (not batched with other tools), so it can be
  executed server-side. Scoped — only added when a search tool is present.
- Server-side web search (Tavily). When `TAVILY_API_KEY` is set, the proxy
  executes `web_search`/`WebSearch` tool calls itself in a bounded loop and
  feeds results back to the model, returning the final answer. Fixes "Did 0
  searches" — Claude Code's search can't run behind a non-Anthropic backend.
  Search tools are also forwarded with a real `{query}` schema. Only engaged
  when a search tool is present; all other requests are unchanged. Knobs:
  `SERVER_SEARCH_ENABLED`, `TAVILY_MAX_RESULTS`, `SERVER_SEARCH_MAX_ITERS`.
- Honor `thinking.display` for adaptive thinking (Opus 4.7/4.8). Thinking text
  is surfaced only when `display` is `"summarized"`; adaptive mode defaults to
  `"omitted"` (matching Anthropic), so the backend's reasoning is no longer
  shown unless asked for. Operator override via `THINKING_DISPLAY_OVERRIDE`.
- Strip `<think>…</think>` from visible text (streaming + non-streaming) whenever
  thinking is not being surfaced, so provider reasoning never leaks as assistant
  text. Fixes the "reasoning visible in output" community reports.
- Dynamic effort forwarding: the effort chosen in Claude Code (`/effort`,
  carried in `output_config.effort`) is automatically mapped to a backend
  `reasoning_effort` (xhigh/max -> high) — no configuration. If a backend
  rejects `reasoning_effort`, the proxy strips it, retries once, and remembers
  not to send it to that model again (self-healing, no repeated latency).
- Surface a model's separate reasoning channel (`reasoning_content` / `reasoning`,
  as emitted by DeepSeek-R1, Qwen, GLM-thinking, etc.) as Claude `thinking`
  content blocks — both streaming and non-streaming.
- Accept inbound `thinking` / `redacted_thinking` blocks in assistant history
  (interleaved thinking). They are parsed without error and dropped during
  conversion, since OpenAI-compatible backends cannot consume them.
- Opt-in reasoning passthrough so reasoning-capable backends actually think:
  `REASONING_EFFORT` (operator override) and `MAP_THINKING_BUDGET_TO_EFFORT`
  (bucket a client `thinking.budget_tokens` into an effort level). Both default
  to no-op, so non-reasoning backends are unaffected.
- `docs/GAP_ANALYSIS_SPEC.md` — gap analysis vs. the current Claude Code CLI and
  a roadmap for agentic/harness work.
- `tests/test_thinking_and_reasoning.py` — unit coverage for the thinking,
  reasoning, and stop-reason changes.

### Fixed
- Codex CLI tool calls are no longer stripped as "unknown tool types". The CLI sends tools with type keys like `text_editor`, `exec_command`, `apply_patch`, etc. These are now converted to OpenAI-style function tools instead of being dropped, so the backend model can correctly emit structured tool calls. `parse_codex_tools()` in `src/codex/tools_compat.py` gains a `_KNOWN_CODEX_TOOL_TYPES` set for this.
- Codex CLI embedded tool call text is now parsed into real `function_call` events. When the model emits tool calls inline within text (Codex CLI format), the proxy extracts them from the content stream via `_extract_tool_calls_from_text()` and emits proper `function_call` events. This happens in the live streaming path (`convert_openai_sse_to_responses_sse`) and the non-streaming response path (`convert_openai_to_responses`).
- Empty `tools: []` array is now dropped from the upstream request. When all Codex tools are stripped (e.g. all builtins with no Tavily config), the proxy no longer sends `tools: []` to the backend, which caused 400 Bad Request from some providers. `convert_responses_to_openai_chat()` now checks whether `tool_ctx.tools` is truthy before adding it to the dict.
- Server-search path no longer drops tool calls. The non-streamed loop result
  was being streamed back via a text-only serializer, so on turns that merely
  *offered* `WebSearch` the model's real tool call (Read/Edit/Agent/...) was
  silently dropped -> "The model's tool call could not be parsed." Added a
  tool_use/thinking-aware SSE serializer (`claude_response_to_sse`) for that path.
- Self-heal on upstream context-length 400s: the proxy now detects when a
  backend rejects a request for exceeding its context window, sheds the oldest
  messages with the existing safe trimmer (system prompt, latest turn, and tool
  pairs preserved) and retries once, instead of surfacing a hard error. If it
  still doesn't fit, a clear message points at `<ROLE>_MODEL_CONTEXT_LIMIT`.
- Strip Kimi-K2's native tool-call control tokens (`<|tool_call_begin|>`,
  `<|tool_call_argument_begin|>`, `functions.NAME:N`, ...) that leak into tool
  arguments when a tool is forwarded without a real parameter schema (e.g. the
  Anthropic `web_search` server tool). The inner JSON is now extracted so the
  client receives clean arguments instead of a token blob.
- Extended-thinking config now understands Anthropic's real wire shape
  `{"type": "enabled"|"disabled", "budget_tokens": N}` (via `is_enabled()`),
  in addition to the legacy `{"enabled": bool}`. Previously `{"type":"disabled"}`
  was ignored and thinking stayed on, and `budget_tokens` was dropped.
- Requests whose assistant history contained `thinking` blocks no longer return
  HTTP 422.
- `thinking.type` accepts any mode string (e.g. `adaptive`), not just
  `enabled`/`disabled`. A strict enum was 422'ing real Claude Code requests that
  send newer thinking modes; only `disabled` turns thinking off.
- A provider `content_filter` finish reason now maps to the Claude `refusal`
  stop reason instead of masquerading as `end_turn`.
- Codex non-streaming tool-call status set to `"completed"` instead of `"in_progress"`.
- Codex session item ordering corrected from `output_items + input_items` to `input_items + output_items` (chronological conversation history).
- Dead code branch removed from Codex request converter.

### Changed
- `.env.example` default `LOG_LEVEL` changed from `INFO` to `WARNING` with expanded documentation describing the four modes (`DEBUG` / `INFO` / `WARNING` / `ERROR`).
- Replaced deprecated `[tool.uv.dev-dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml` with the standard `[dependency-groups.dev]` section. Eliminates the UV deprecation warning during package builds.
- Added `refusal`, `pause_turn`, and `model_context_window_exceeded` stop-reason
  constants (only `refusal` is emitted today; the others are reserved for
  server-tool / upstream-error wiring).

### Removed
- Reverted an experimental 1M-context `betas` override. Context window size
  remains owned solely by the per-model `*_MODEL_CONTEXT_LIMIT` settings, which
  are also what the statusline's `/api/observability/context-usage` endpoint
  reads (capped at 200K to match Claude Code). To run a 1M-capable model, set
  its `*_MODEL_CONTEXT_LIMIT` accordingly.

## [1.0.0]

- Initial baseline: Claude `/v1/messages` proxy to Nebius OpenAI-compatible
  endpoints, with streaming SSE, model routing (big/middle/small/vision),
  tool-call JSON repair, local request optimizations, and the observability
  dashboard. (Pre-changelog history is in the git log.)
